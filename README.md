# SPL Projects template

**Note**: Delete this in your project repository and add details concerned to your project.

## Guidelines

This is a template for other projects to follow. It has two main folders, `src` and `tests`. Please place all the source code of your project in the `src` folder, and write any test functions to test the code in the `tests` folder.

__Note__:Rename `src` with a unique name if you are working with multiple repos in a single project.

Opening Issues are encouraged in any of the projects as well as pull requests (PRs). Regarding both, please add clear descriptions of the issues and PRs for the developers to understand the issue at hand.
